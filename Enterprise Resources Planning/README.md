## Proposed Improvement: Small Zone for Picking Process

### Current Issue
The existing **DAS(Digital Assortment System)** processes 200 orders simultaneously, which can lead to inefficiencies, especially when multiple orders contain only one item.

### Solution: Small Zone Implementation
We propose creating a **Small Zone** dedicated to handling single-product orders.
